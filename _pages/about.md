### “Downward Is The Only Way Forward.” — Dom Cobb (Inception)

I am a Ph.D. student and research assistant at the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas,
working in the [Multimodal Signal Processing (MSP) Laboratory](https://ecs.utdallas.edu/research/researchlabs/msp-lab/), under the mentorship of Dr. Carlos Busso.  My research interests include affective computing, deep learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction (HCI), focusing primarily on developing efficient models and algorithms for low-powered, personalized, dynamic facial expression recognition systems. I am also interested in data collection and am part of the team responsible for the MSP-Face, MSP-Podcast, MSP-GEO, and NaturalVoices datasets.
